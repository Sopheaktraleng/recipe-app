# Quick Fix - SonarQube is Disabled

Your Jenkinsfile already has SonarQube disabled (it's commented out). You need to commit and push this change to GitHub.

## What to Do:

### 1. Verify the Jenkinsfile is updated

Your current Jenkinsfile already has SonarQube disabled (see lines 22-40 are commented).

### 2. Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add the changes
git add Jenkinsfile

# Commit
git commit -m "fix: disable SonarQube until sonar-scanner is installed"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 3. Re-run the Jenkins Build

After pushing, Jenkins will pull the updated Jenkinsfile and SonarQube will be skipped.

## Alternative: Want to Enable SonarQube?

If you want SonarQube to work, you need to install sonar-scanner on Jenkins server:

```bash
# SSH into Jenkins server
ssh your-jenkins-server

# Install sonar-scanner
cd /tmp
wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-scanner-cli/sonar-scanner-cli-4.8.0.2856-linux.zip
unzip sonar-scanner-cli-4.8.0.2856-linux.zip
sudo mv sonar-scanner-4.8.0.2856-linux /opt/sonar-scanner
sudo ln -sf /opt/sonar-scanner/bin/sonar-scanner /usr/local/bin/sonar-scanner
sonar-scanner -v  # Verify installation

# Then uncomment SonarQube stages in Jenkinsfile (lines 22-40)
```

## Current Status:

✅ Jenkinsfile has SonarQube disabled (commented out)
⏳ Waiting for you to push to GitHub
⏳ Then pipeline will work without SonarQube
